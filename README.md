# mnist-challenge

Script for a coding challenge that makes use of the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset.

The challenge is to train a neural network to either add or subtract two MNIST digits, based on a third (binary) input. The model is implemented in PyTorch and produces a confusion matrix (calculated using the validation set) to provide a visual accuracy assessment.
